üí¨ Product Reviews (with Authorization)
Users can leave reviews on products they've purchased.
The API ensures that:

Only authenticated users can leave reviews.

A user cannot review the same product more than once.

Reviews include a rating and comment, and are linked to both the product and the user.

This logic is handled via middleware that checks the user's authentication and verifies eligibility before allowing review creation.
